This is a Kotlin-based Android app for managing a music playlist. The app allows users to add songs to a playlist, including song title, artist name, rating (1-5), and user comments. Users can view their playlist, calculate the average rating of the songs, and navigate between the main and detailed view screens. The app is designed with error handling to ensure smooth user interaction.
